# OnlineShop
It's my first project. It won't be secure at all, or use the newest frameworks. I'm learning GIT, backend and I have a 
some free time :) 

This whole project is about making working (or something looking like) online shop.  I have some ideas for design 
and data structure (I've put it in 'visualisations' directory). In this project, I will use Java language with Spring 
framework, IntelliJ IDEA IDE, Visual Studio Code. I've chosen MySql as database server.
