# OnlineShop
It's my first project. I don't think it will be verry secure, or use a newest frameworks. I'm learning GIT, and I have a lot of free time :) 

This whole project is about making working online shop.  I have some ideas for design and data structure (I've put it in 'visualisations' directory).
In this project, I will use Java language with Spring framework, InteliJ IDEA IDE, Visual Studio Code. I haven't figured out what frontend tools, 
frameworks to use in future.
